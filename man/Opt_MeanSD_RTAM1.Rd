\title{Optimizing Function in RTAM1}
\usage{
Opt_MeanSD_RTAM1(Normalized_log, Order_Matrix, nGene, Min_nGene, gene_cutoff)
}
\arguments{
\item{Normalized_log}{the matrix of Log2(.+1)-normalized data}

\item{Order_Matrix}{the matrix of original order of gene expressions per cell}

\item{nGene}{number of expressed genes}

\item{Min_nGene}{minimum number of expressed genes across entire population}

\item{gene_cutoff}{the cutoff to calculate the summation of top (nonzero) gene expressions}
}
\value{
The output is the CV (sd/mean) of RTAM1 normalization for given nGene, Min_nGene and gene_cutoff
}
\description{
An auxiliary fucntion to detect the optimal number of top-expressed genes for scaling a data-set using RTAM1
}
\note{
Please refer to the reference and supplemental materials described in the README for additional details.
