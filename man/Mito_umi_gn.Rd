\usage{
Mito_umi_gn(mat, percent.mito.G, nUMI, nGene, No.test, drop.mads = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{raw data matrix}

\item{percent.mito.G}{percentage of mitochondrial transcripts relative to total number of reads per cell}

\item{nUMI}{number of unified molecular identification (UMI)}

\item{nGene}{number of expressed genes}

\item{No.test}{number of test cells included in the data; can be used to delineate the populations of test and control cells in the heatmap}

\item{drop.mads}{number of the median absolute deviation (MAD) to drop damaged cells using the percentage of mitochondrial expression level}
}
\value{
The output represents damaged cells due to the given  for mitochondrial percentage cutoff
}
\description{
Function to sketch mitochondrial transcript content, nUMI and nGene data at cellular level to detect damaged cells within the population
