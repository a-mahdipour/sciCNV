\title{RTAM Nomalization Function}
\usage{
RTAM_normalization(mat, method, Min_nGn, Optimizing)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{The raw data matrix has genes as rows and cells as columns}

\item{Genes}{are annotated with their genomic location (start and end locations)}

\item{Order_Matrix}{is the original order of genes in the raw data}

\item{MinNumGenes}{is a threshold used to exclude poor QC cells that have few detectable genes (default= minimum of 250 genes).}

\item{OptNumGenes}{is the number of genes that when employed for RTAM normalization will optimally minimize the variance across cells of gene-set average expression}
}
\value{
The output is RTAM1 or 2 normalzied data at higher sensitivity, specificity and acuracy for all transcriptions (at loqwe, intermediate and higher levels)
}
\description{
RTAM1/2 normalization designed for but not limited to scRNA-seq data
